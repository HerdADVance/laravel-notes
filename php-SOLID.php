Single Responsibility
// classes should have only one job

Open for Extension, Closed for Modification
// easily add new features without modifying existing code

Liskov Substitution Principle
// objects replaceable by subtypes without breaking

Innterface Segregation
// don't force methods on classes that don't use them

Dependency Inversion
// high level modules should depend on abstractions, not on low level modules
